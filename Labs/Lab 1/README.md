# CPE 322 - Lab 1: GHDL & GTKWave
### Instructions:
Go to the GitHub repository for Digital System Design( 
[DSD GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd.git)
). Navigate to GHDL folder. Install GHDL & GTKWave. Run Half Adder Example and another example such as D Flip Flop or 4-1 Multiplexer. 
Document results on your GitHub repository.

## Summary 
In this lab, I gained experience working with GHDL and GTKWave, which are essential tools for digital circuit simulation and analysis. GHDL serves as a VHDL compiler that converts hardware descriptions into executable code, enabling simulation of digital designs. GTKWave complements this by providing a graphical interface to inspect and analyze signal waveforms, making it easier to debug and understand circuit behavior.
